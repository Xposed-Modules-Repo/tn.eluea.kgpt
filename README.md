## Introduction

A special thanks to **Mino260806** for establishing the original idea and foundation upon which this project was developed. Without their initial work, this repository would not exist today.

**KGPT** is a powerful tool designed to integrate your favorite AI models directly into your keyboard, allowing you to use them seamlessly across various tasks and activities on your device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is NOT just a standard update of the original project.**
> This is a complete **structural rebuild and redesign from scratch**. The code has been rewritten with an entirely different infrastructure, changing the core logic and introducing features that never existed before.
